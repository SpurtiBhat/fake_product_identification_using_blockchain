🔍 Blockchain-Based Fake Product Detection Using QR Codes
A smart contract system built with Solidity to verify the authenticity of products in a supply chain using QR codes, ensuring transparency and trust between manufacturers, sellers, and consumers.

📦 Project Overview
Counterfeit products are a major global issue. This system provides a decentralized, tamper-proof solution to track a product's lifecycle from manufacturer to end consumer. Every product has a unique QR code generated by the manufacturer, which the consumer can later use to verify its authenticity.

👥 Key Roles
Manufacturer: Creates product and QR code, assigns to seller

Seller: Receives products from manufacturers, sells to consumers

Consumer: Scans the QR code to verify the genuineness of a product

🔐 Core Features
✅ Add and manage sellers

✅ Add products with unique QR codes

🔄 Transfer product ownership from manufacturer → seller → consumer

📜 Immutable purchase history

🧾 QR code verification for authenticity

🔍 Instant consumer-side validation (fake or genuine)

💻 Tech Stack
Solidity for Smart Contract logic

Ethereum Blockchain for transparent record keeping

Frontend using HTML,CSS

QR Code Generator library for encoding product ID

🔧 Functions Breakdown
👨‍🏭 Manufacturer
addProduct(...): Adds a product with unique serial and brand info

generateQR(productSN): Creates QR code for product SN

transferToSeller(productSN, sellerCode): Transfers product to a seller

🛒 Seller
addSeller(...): Registers seller info

sellToConsumer(productSN, consumerAddress): Transfers ownership

👤 Consumer
verifyProduct(productSN): Returns whether the product is Genuine ✅ or Fake ❌

📲 Usage Flow
Manufacturer adds product → QR Code generated

Product assigned to seller

Seller sells to consumer

Consumer scans QR code → Interacts with smart contract

Smart contract returns:

✅ Genuine if ownership flow is valid

❌ Fake if tampered or invalid SN
